## Usage

### Shorten a URL

To shorten a URL, send a POST request to the `/url` endpoint with a JSON body containing the original URL:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}' http://localhost:3000/url
```

### Retrieve the original URL

To retrieve the original URL associated with a shortened URL, send a GET request to the shortened URL:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/{shortCode}
```

Replace {shortCode} with the short code generated for the URL.
